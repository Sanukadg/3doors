Objective: 
  In this "game" there are 3 doors. And behind one of these doors is a diamond. It is placed randomly behind one of the doors at the start of every round. 
  At the beginning of the game, the user is asked to pick the door that they think the diamond is behind, and then the program will reveal one of the other 2 doors as empty. Then the user
  is asked if they want to switch their choice of door. 
  Statistically, it shows that if the user switches the door at that point, there is about ~66% chance of them picking the right door with the diamond behind it.
